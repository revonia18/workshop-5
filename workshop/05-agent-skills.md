# Exercise 5 - Using agent skills

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that Copilot can load when relevant to improve its performance in specialized tasks. [Agent Skills is an open standard][agent-skills-repo], used by a range of different agents. Agent skills works in Copilot Chat in Agent Mode, Copilot Coding Agent (CCA), and Copilot CLI.

Let's explore skills, how they're utilized by AI agents, and how we can use a skill to ensure actions are performed according to the specifications set forth by our team.

## Scenario

You are a part-time developer for Tailspin Toys - a crowdfunding platform for games with a developer theme. The team has a set of requirements for pull requests (PR):

- clear commit messages, with files grouped logically.
- all tests must pass before a PR is created.
- each PR must contain the following sections:
    - a description of why the changes were made.
    - an overview of the files changed.
    - snippets of important code blocks.
    - details of the changes made grouped together.

As the team is using Copilot to generate code and PRs, it wants to ensure the AI tools follow these requirements.

In this exercise you will:

- explore an existing skill for creating pull requests.
- learn how skills are utilized by the AI agent.
- create a PR which matches the guidelines with the help of the skill.

## Agent skills

Skills allow you to tell Copilot and other AI agents how to perform specific tasks. This might include how to run tests, deploy projects, or create a PR. Skills are included in the project in the **.github/skills** folder, or globally in **~/.copilot/skills**.

Each skill is defined as a folder with a name. Each folder then contains a **SKILL.md** file, which defines the skill. The **SKILL.md** file must have YAML frontmatter with a name and description.

```yaml
---
name: branches-commits-prs
description: All changes to the repository must be done through a pull request (PR). A branch must always be created, and commits grouped together logically. Whenever asked to create commit messages, to push code, or create a pull request (PR), use this skill so everything is done correctly.
---
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Skills are loaded dynamically by the agent when the agent determines they're needed. It does so by utilizing the description. Having clear descriptions which defines when they should be used is key to success.

Skills can also have subfolders with scripts, assets and references to provide additional information and capabilities. You can explore the full [specification][agent-skills-spec] to learn more about how skills are defined.

## Executing skills

Skills are loaded dynamically when the agent determines they're necessary. The decision of what skills to use is driven by the description in the **SKILL.md** file. As such, it's important to have clear descriptions which define the use case for the skill.

## Exploring the PR skill

Because Tailspin Toys has a set of requirements for creating PRs, they created a skill to help AI tools be able to generate PRs which follow these guidelines. Let's explore the skill to understand what it'll do.

1. Return to your codespace.
2. Open **.github/skills/branches-commits-prs/SKILL.md**.
3. Note the name and description. Notice how the description highlights the scenario in which it should be used, which is whenever a request is made to create a pull request or committing code.
4. Read through the skill. Notice the rules are defined about how branches should be created, commits generated, and the contents of the pull request.

## Using the skill

As highlighted previously, skills are automatically invoked by Copilot CLI. As a result, all we need to do is ask Copilot to create a PR!

> [!NOTE]
> At this point, your working tree should contain the filtering code generated in Exercise 4. The publishers endpoint from Exercise 2 was already committed to `main`, so this PR will contain only the filtering changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exercise assumes you are working in **your own repository created from the template** and that Copilot CLI is authenticated to GitHub with permission to create branches and pull requests. Because the PR is created through the built-in GitHub MCP server, you must also start Copilot CLI with the `--enable-all-github-mcp-tools` flag so write operations are allowed.

1. Return to your codespace.
2. If not already open, open a terminal window by utilizing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd>.
3. If not already running, start Copilot CLI by issuing the following command in the terminal window:

    ```bash
    copilot --allow-all-tools --enable-all-github-mcp-tools
    ```

4. Ask Copilot to create a PR by using the following prompt:

    ```
    Can you please create a pull request for me!
    ```

5. Copilot will acknowledge the request. After a few moments, you'll notice Copilot will indicate it's utilizing the **branches-commits-prs** skill.

6. Copilot will then follow the instructions in the skill. It will start by running the tests. Then it will create a branch, commits, and eventually the PR.
7. Once the PR is created, return to your repository and open the PR. Note the sections follow the guidelines set forth in the skill, matching the requirements the team put forth.

## Summary and next steps

With the help of an agent skill, you created a new PR which matches documented requirements! You:

- explored an existing skill for creating pull requests.
- learned how skills are utilized by the AI agent.
- created a PR which matches the guidelines with the help of the skill.
